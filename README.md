# Final-Avocado-Assignment
# Introduction
This project aims to classify the type of avocados (Organic or Conventional) and predict their average prices using a regression model. The dataset comprises data from the years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.
# Data Description
The dataset includes the following features:

Date: The date of the observation.

AveragePrice: The average price of a single avocado.

Total Volume: The total number of avocados sold.

4046: Total number of avocados sold with PLU 4046.

4225: Total number of avocados sold with PLU 4225.

4770: Total number of avocados sold with PLU 4770.

Total Bags: Total number of bags sold.

Small Bags: Total number of small bags sold.

Large Bags: Total number of large bags sold.

XLarge Bags: Total number of extra-large bags sold.

type: The type of avocado (conventional or organic).

year: The year of the observation.

region: The region of the observation.

# Objectives
1.	Classification: Identify whether an avocado is Organic or Conventional.
2.	
3.	Regression: Predict the average price of an avocado.
4.	
# Methodology
# 1.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Convert date fields to appropriate formats.
Encode categorical variables (type, region) using One-Hot Encoding.

# 2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of prices for organic and conventional avocados.
Analyze trends over the years and regions.
Identify correlations between features.

# 3.	Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary (e.g., month, season).
Normalize or standardize numerical features.

# 4.	Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Classification Models: Use algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
Regression Models: Use algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and MSE, RMSE, R-squared (for regression).

# 5.	Model Evaluation and Tuning:

Perform hyperparameter tuning.
Use cross-validation to ensure model generalization.

# 6.	Deployment and Insights:

Deploy the models for real-time classification and prediction.

Provide actionable insights based on model predictions and classifications.

# Expected Outcomes

A robust classification model to distinguish between organic and conventional avocados.

An accurate regression model to predict the average price of avocados.

Insights into trends and factors affecting avocado prices.

# Requirements

Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
